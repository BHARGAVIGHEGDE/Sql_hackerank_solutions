Problem:Amber's conglomerate corporation just acquired some new companies. Each of the companies follows this hierarchy: 

Given the table schemas below, write a query to print the company_code, founder name, total number of lead managers, total number of senior managers, total number of managers, and total number of employees. Order your output by ascending company_code.

Note:

The tables may contain duplicate records.
The company_code is string, so the sorting should not be numeric. For example, if the company_codes are C_1, C_2, and C_10, then the ascending company_codes will be C_1, C_10, and C_2.

Solution:

select 
    company.company_code,
    company.founder,
    count(distinct lead_manager_code), 
    count(distinct senior_manager_code), 
    count(distinct manager_code), 
    count(distinct employee_code) 
from 
    company 
inner join 
    employee on company.company_code = employee.company_code 
group by 
    company.company_code, company.founder
order by 
    company.company_code;
