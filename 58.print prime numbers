problem:Write a query to print all prime numbers less than or equal to . Print your result on a single line, and use the ampersand () character as your separator (instead of a space).

For example, the output for all prime numbers  would be:
solution:

WITH RECURSIVE t AS (
    SELECT 2 AS nums
    UNION
    SELECT nums + 1
    FROM t
    WHERE nums < 1000
)
SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(nums SEPARATOR '&')
FROM t
WHERE nums NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT a.nums
    FROM t a
    JOIN t b
    ON b.nums != a.nums 
        AND a.nums % b.nums = 0
)
