problem:You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!

The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the result by ascending hacker_id. Exclude all hackers with a total score of   0 from your result.

SELECT H.hacker_id, H.name, SUM(M.max_score) AS total_score
FROM (
    SELECT S.hacker_id, S.challenge_id, max(S.score) as max_score
    FROM Submissions S GROUP BY S.hacker_id, S.challenge_id
    ) M
JOIN Hackers H ON H.hacker_id = M.hacker_id
GROUP BY H.hacker_id, H.name
HAVING total_score > 0
ORDER BY total_score DESC, H.hacker_id ASC;
